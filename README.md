# ufpa-face-detection

Face detection for Octave / Matlab based on Viola &amp; Jones' algorithm [1].

This code runs both on Octave and Matlab. Note that Mathworks has its own implementation [2]. OpenCV also provides an implementation [3].

Convention: all files (scripts and functions) start with the prefix ufd_ (UFPA face detection). 

The face detector has a training and a test stages. The main scripts for training and testing are: ufd_train and ufd_test, respectively.

Development strategy:

- We will use the training stage of OpenCV and import the classifier
